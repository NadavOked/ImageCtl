# pull.sh -- registering a single-station unicast restore with the server, so
# that the progress reports in progress.sh have a session id to travel under.
# POSIX sh (busybox ash). Sourced after progress.sh: pull_close calls
# report_final.
#
# It lived inside progress.sh until #562, on the reasoning below -- opening a
# pull is a reporting concern and not a screen. That reasoning still holds and
# the file order preserves it; what did not hold is one file carrying both, at
# 316 lines against a 300-line wall.

# The interface: interfaces.md, "משיכת יוניקאסט לתחנה בודדת".
#
# A single-station restore pulls the image over HTTP. The bytes move whether
# or not the server was told -- /api/v1/images/... serves them to any machine
# in the registry -- so opening a pull is not asking permission. It is how the
# work becomes *visible*: a session id to address the reports above to, a line
# in the journal, and a row on the console. Until the agent called it, a
# station pulled for twenty minutes while the operator watched an idle
# server (#60 built the server side, #63 is this side).

    # older than the endpoint and the restore should simply go on unwatched;

    # falling over. Folding them into "the pull failed" sends a technician
