# poll.sh -- how long the agent waits between two idle hellos (#136).
# POSIX sh (busybox ash). No bashisms, no job control.
#
# hello is both "I am here" and the poll, and every hello is a DB write on
# the server (net_seen). A flat two seconds meant 600 writes a minute for a
# class of 20 -- at exactly the moment the server is opening a round.
#
# The ladder is 2 -> 5 -> 15 seconds, and it has two hard brakes on it. Both
# were measured in the code, not assumed:
#
# 1. **An open round pins the fast rate.** Deployment is multicast, and the
#    spec (28) sends late joiners to the *next* round -- so a station that
#    notices "running" fifteen seconds late has not been delayed, it has
#    missed the round. While session.state is "open" this is not idle
#    polling, it is the synchronisation itself.
#
# 2. **The ceiling must stay under room.AWAKE_SECONDS (=30).** The cloning
#    room screen calls a machine awake from its last_seen, and that is the
#    only heartbeat reader in the whole server (room.py:_is_awake, spec 29
#    stage 3). A poll slower than 30 seconds would flash the drawers between
#    "on" and "off". The build machine needs no heartbeat at all -- nothing
#    computes awake for it -- so the ceiling is set by the cloners.
#
# **The reset trigger is a change in the server's answer**, not a timer and
# not local activity: cloner machines are powered on together with the build
# machine in an unknown order, so one that came up first has been waiting --
# and a time-based reset would leave it slow at exactly the moment the work
# starts. A changed answer *is* that moment.
#
# The conscious price (Nadav's call): a capture ordered from the console can
# sit unseen for up to POLL_MAX seconds before the build machine asks again.
# That path has no round to pin it fast, and 15 is the accepted ceiling.
