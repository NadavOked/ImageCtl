"""#1438 -- the room round and the capture hash and count inside fanout.

`pv | tee | sha256sum` became `fanout -S <sha file> -P <counter>`. Two
things must not move with it:

* **What is hashed.** The manifest's sha256 is the sha256 of the compressed
  stream exactly as uploaded -- byte-identical to what `sha256sum` produced
  before. The test hashes what the fake curl actually received.
* **What the readers parse.** `fanout -S` writes 64 lowercase hex digits and
  a newline; `sha256sum` wrote "<hex>  -". Both readers (`capture.sh` for the
  manifest, `drawers.sh` for the round verdict) take `awk '{print $1}'`, and
  these tests pin the files they read to the format the binary writes.

And one new state that did not exist before: `-S` is written only at a clean
EOF, so "no sha file" is now possible where sha256sum always printed
something. A capture without a hash must be refused, never shipped with
`"sha256":""` for the server to reject an hour later.
